## User-Search
 Find users by username on many different websites.

## Requirements
- `node` (https://nodejs.org)
- `npm`

## Installation
In a command prompt in your projects folder, run the following:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/quantiom/user-search.git
cd user-search
npm install # or use yarn
node index -u <username>
```

## Adding/Removing Websites
To add or remove websites, run the `manageSites.js` script by typing `node manageSites` in console, and follow the instructions.
All the websites are stored in `sites.json`, so you can edit manually instead.

## Credits
Most of the websites in the list were gotten from [sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock/blob/master/data.json).
